## About The Project
![](bookshelf.gif)

A simple Bookshelf Application project developed with Flutter that allows you to keep track of your reading progress and organize your book collection. In making this app, we implemented all the Flutter basics such as Stateless & Statefull Widget, Navigator, Nested ListView, SingleChildScrollView, DraggableScrollableSheet, Stack, JSON parsing, Future Builder, etc.

The purpose of this project is to do some exercises and apply what I have learned from the Flutter Apprentice, Second Edition Book (Chapters 1-2).
